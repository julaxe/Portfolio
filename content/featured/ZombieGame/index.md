Knowing that the gaming industry is evolving and in constant change, I wanted to be "ahead of the curve" and start learning DoD (Data-oriented design).

Unity has been experimenting with DoD in the last years, making a big update this 2022 in his Unity Dots package. That's why I wanted to start making
different type of games and test the performance with this new way of programming (new in Video games). So far the results are amazing and I believe DoD will be a most in the future.
